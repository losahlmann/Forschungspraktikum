\chapter{Introduction}

	cyber-physical systems
	combine computation, control of physical processes
	discrete and continuous dynamics
	often safety-critical
	(prone to) software verification

	hybrid systems: mathematical model to describe CPS
	combine discrete computation
	continuous dynamics: differential equations
	infinite state space

	examples:
	self-driving cars
	aircraft collision-avoidance systems
	train control



	differential dynamic logic
	logic for specify, verify safety and liveness properties
	of hybrid systems
	models of cyber-physical systems
	ordinary differential equations
