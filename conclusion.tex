    \section{Future Work}
    	compute invariants and differential invariants

    	uniform substitution calculus, proof rules, substitutes formula for a predicate symbol
    	US, classical rule in for first-order logic proof calculus
    	have axioms instead of axiom schemata
    	leads to a calculus with finite number od \ddL formulas as axioms
    	to facilitate a sound implementation in a prover

        completeness

    	state dependent delay
    	    % TODO: source for state-dependent and distributed delays
    % The definition of a DDE can be extended to state-dependent or distributed delays

    potential implementation in Keymaera X: use modularity, existing axioms, lemmata
    axiomatization, proof rules important for automatization of proofs
    for that as \dL in \cite{Platzer15Uniform} no axiom schemata, but finite number of axioms and proof rules (sets of formulas)
proof rule for substitution on axiom preserving soundness
