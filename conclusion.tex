    \section{Future Work}
    	compute invariants and differential invariants

    	uniform substitution calculus, proof rules, substitutes formula for a predicate symbol
    	US, classical rule in for first-order logic proof calculus
    	have axioms instead of axiom schemata
    	leads to a calculus with finite number od \ddL formulas as axioms
    	to facilitate a sound implementation in a prover
