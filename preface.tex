    Cyber Physical Systems incorporate the connection between the physical world and computing devices.
    This connection is often given by a computer network, which needs hence to be considered in the system model.

    In this work we extend Differential Dynamic Logic with Delay Differential Equations.

    This requires an extension of the syntax, a (partially) redefinition of the semantics and the introduction of additional axioms and proof rules.

    This results in a superset of \dL which we call \emph{Delay Differential Dynamic Logic}.

    the resulting logics extends

    provide a program notation for hybrid systems with delay

    static and dynamic semantics
    differential-forms, to reason in axiomatic way about DDEs
    modular soundness proof
    axiomatization
    proof calculus
