\chapter{Delay Differential Equations}

Differential equations are often used to describe the dynamics of a deterministic system, whose future behavior depends on the present state.
For an \emph{ordinary differential equation} (ODE), this state is an element of $\R^n$. The rate of change only depends on the current time instant.

In \emph{delay differential equations} (DDEs) however, the system is influenced by the past through the appearance of a deviated time argument. This means that the current state needs to contain the previous evolution.
This leads to a functional state space, whose elements are functions on a past time interval.
For that reason, DDEs belong to the class of \emph{functional differential equations} (FDEs).

% TODO: add \cite
DDEs often appear in automatic control, where a controller monitors the state of a system in order to make control decisions to adjust this state.
If there is a delay between the observation and the control action, the differential equation describing the system not only depends on its current state, but also on its past.
These previous values need to be specified in an initial condition, for at least the time of the longest delay.

%neutral type: rhs also depends on deriv of init cond

Examples of phenomena which have been modeled using delay differential equations include epidemics, traffic flow and vibrations/chattering. See \cite{Falbo06FDEs} and the references therein for a number of examples.

Some methods to solve basic DDEs analytically are presented in \cite{Falbo06FDEs}. Numerical procedures are not as far developed as for ODEs.
See \cite{Bellen13NumericalDDEs}, or \cite{Szczlina14RigorousDDEs} for a rigorous integration algorithm.

\section{Piecewise Continuous Functions}
    \label{sec:piecewise-continuous-functions}

    The following definition is motivated by the character of evolution arising from hybrid systems. We define the main functional space of operation for the following chapters.

    \begin{definition}[Piecewise Continuously Differentiable]
    \label{def:pw-cont-diff}
        Let $D=\compactum{a}{b}\subseteq\R$ be a closed interval (this includes the cases when $a=-\infty$ or $b=\infty$, or both). The mapping $x\from D\to\R^n$ is called $m$-times \emph{piecewise continuously differentiable} if and only if there is a finite partition (ordered set) $\partition[t_1]{a=t_0}{t_p=b}$ of $D$, such that $x$ is $m$-times continuously differentiable on each interval $(t_i,t_{i+1})$ with \foreignlanguage{frenchb}{\emph{càdlàg} (\og continue à droite, limite à gauche\fg{})} derivative:
        Everywhere on $D$, the function $x$ and each of its derivatives $\D[k]{x}$ are right continuous and have left limits.

        More precisely, for all $i=\range{0}{p-1}$ and for all $k=\range{0}{m}$ exist the left limits
        \begin{equation}\label{eq:left-limit}
            \lim_{\substack{t\upto t_{i+1}\\ t\in(t_i,t_{i+1})}} \D[k]{x}(t)
        \end{equation}
        as well as the right limits
        \begin{equation}\label{eq:right-limit}
            \lim_{\substack{t\downto t_{i}\\ t\in(t_i,t_{i+1})}} \D[k]{x}(t) = \D[k]{x}(t_i)
        \end{equation}
        which additionally coincide with the value of $\D[k]{x}$ at this knot $t_i$.
        The same holds for these limits inside the intervals, i.e.\ for $t\to s\in\open{t_i}{t_{i+1}}$.
        Hence $x$ can have an isolated point only in the right interval limit $b$.

        In the case $m=0$, we say $x$ is \emph{piecewise continuous}.
        For a compact $D\subset\R$ (this excludes the cases with $\pm\infty$), we denote by $\Cnpw[m]{D}{\R^n}$ the set of \emph{$m$-times piecewise continuously differentiable functions} on $D$ mapping to $\R^n$, and respectively, by $\Cnpw[0]{D}{\R^n}$ the set of \emph{piecewise continuous functions} on $D$.

        The supremum norm $\supnorm{\cdot}$ of the Banach space of continuous functions on the compactum $D$ can be extended to $\Cnpw[m]{D}{\R^n}$, since each element consists of a finite number of continuous parts.
    \end{definition}

    In the following, when we talk about \emph{piecewise continuous} and \emph{piecewise continuously differentiable}, we refer to it in the sense of Definition~\ref{def:pw-cont-diff}.
    Let us note some basic observations which will be used subsequently.

    % FIXME: where doe I need chain lemma?
    \begin{lemma}\label{lm:comp-pw-cont}
        The composition of a continuous (outer) and a piecewise continuous function (inner) is again piecewise continuous with the same partition.
    \end{lemma}
    \begin{proof}
        The limits~\eqref{eq:left-limit} and~\eqref{eq:right-limit} exist, because they commute with the continuous outer function and exist for the piecewise-continuous inner function.
    \end{proof}

    \begin{lemma}\label{lm:pc-integrable}
        A piecewise continuous function is (Riemann) integrable.
    \end{lemma}
    \begin{proof}
        This proof is usually given in every standard analysis book, see for example~\cite[Theorem~6.10]{Rudin76PrinciplesAnalysis} or~\cite[Example~11.16b]{Gathmann12GDM}.
    \end{proof}

    The following lemma generalizes the fundamental theorem of calculus to piecewise continuous derivatives.

    \begin{lemma}\label{lm:pc-hauptsatz}
        Let $F\in\Cn[0]{\compactum{a}{b}}{} \cap \Cnpw[1]{\compactum{a}{b}}{}$
        % with the partition $\partition{a=t_0}{t_m=b}$
        with piecewise derivative $f$. Then
        \begin{equation*}
            F(t)-F(a) = \integral{a}{t} f(s)\dx[s]
            %\sum_{i=0}^k\int\limits_{t_i}^{t_{i+1}}f(t)\dx[t] + \int\limits_{t_k}^s f(t)\dx[t]
        \end{equation*}
        for all $t\in\compactum{a}{b}$.
        %where $t_k\leq s < t_{k+1}$.
    \end{lemma}
    \begin{proof}
        Let $\partition{a=t_0}{t_p=b}$ the partition for $f$.
        On each compact interval $\compactum{t_{i-1}}{t_i}$, $f$ is piecewise continuous and hence integrable (Lemma~\ref{lm:pc-integrable}).

        By precondition is $F$ differentiable on $\compactum{t_{i-1}}{\zeta}$ with $\D{F}=f$ for all $\zeta\in\open{t_{i-1}}{t_i}$.
        For that reason, the fundamental theorem of calculus (cf.\ standard analysis literature, e.g.~\cite{Gathmann12GDM,Rudin76PrinciplesAnalysis}) yields
        \begin{equation*}
            \denseintegral{t_{i-1}}{\zeta} f(s)\dx[s] = F(\zeta)-F(t_{i-1})
        \end{equation*}
        and by the continuity of $F$ that
        \begin{equation*}
            \denseintegral{t_{i-1}}{t_i} f(s)\dx[s]
            = \lim_{\zeta\to t_i}\denseintegral{t_{i-1}}{\zeta} f(s)\dx[s]
            = \lim_{\zeta\to t_i} F(\zeta)-F(t_{i-1})
            = F(t_i)-F(t_{i-1})
        \end{equation*}
        For any $t\in\compactum{a}{b}$, there is a $k\in\set{\range{1}{p}}$ such that $t\in\closedopen{t_{k-1}}{t_k}$ (in the case $t=b$, set $k=p$), summation over $i=\range{1}{k}$ yields the telescoping series
        \begin{equation*}
            F(t)-F(a) = \sum_{i=1}^{k-1} \denseintegral{t_{i-1}}{t_i} f(s)\dx[s] + \denseintegral{t_{k-1}}{t} f(s)\dx[s]
        \end{equation*}
        what is by the additivity of the integral equivalent to
        \begin{equation*}
            F(t)-F(a) = \integral{a}{t} f(s)\dx[s].
        \end{equation*}
    \end{proof}


\section{Definition of DDE}
    \label{sec:definition-dde}

    There are different possibilities to define delay differential equations, depending on what application one has in mind.
    We restrict to a class adapted to our needs and often found in literature (see for example~\cite{Roussel04DDEs}) and which covers a wide range of applications.

    \begin{definition}[Delay Differential Equation]\label{def:dde}
        Given a function $f\from\deff\to\R^n$ and a set of time delays $\Set{\tau_j\in\R\with 0<\tau_1<\ldots<\tau_k}$, a functional equation of the form
        \begin{equation}\label{eq:dde}
            \D{x}(t) = f(t,x(t),x(t-\tau_1),\ldots,x(t-\tau_k))
        \end{equation}
        is called (first order) \emph{delay differential equation} (DDE) with \emph{multiple constant, discrete delays} $\tau_j$.
        It is said to be \emph{autonomous}, if its right hand side $f$ is independent of $t$ and \emph{pure}, if the right hand side only depends on $x(t-\tau_j)$ but not on $x(t)$.
        We define its \emph{maximal} and \emph{minimal delay} as $\taumax\defeq\tau_k$ and $\taumin\defeq\tau_1$, respectively.

        A DDE can be equipped with an \emph{initial condition} $x_{\tzero}\from \compactum{\tzero-\taumax}{\tzero} \to\R^n$. It specifies the initial state, i.e.\ the values of $x$, on which the right hand side depends, starting from $t=\tzero$.
        Together, such a pair is called \emph{initial value problem} (IVP):
        \begin{equation}\label{eq:ivp}
            \begin{cases}
                \D{x}(t) = f(t,x(t),x(t-\tau_1),\ldots,x(t-\tau_k)) & \text{for } t\geq\tzero\\
                x(t) = x_{\tzero}(t) & \text{for } t\in\compactum{\tzero-\taumax}{\tzero}
            \end{cases}
        \end{equation}
    \end{definition}

    \begin{definition}[Solution of DDE]\label{def:solution-dde}
        A function $x\from\compactum{\tzero-\taumax}{\tzero+T}\to\R^n$ is called \emph{(local) solution} of the initial value problem~\eqref{eq:ivp}, if and only if there exists a $T>0$ such that
        $x$ obeys the initial condition
        \begin{equation*}
            x(t) = x_{\tzero}(t) \quad\text{for } t\in\compactum{\tzero-\taumax}{\tzero}
        \end{equation*}
        and $x$ is continuous and piecewise continuously differentiable on $\compactum{\tzero}{\tzero+T}$, fulfilling
        \begin{equation*}
            \D{x}(t) = f(t,x(t),x(t-\tau_1),\ldots,x(t-\tau_k))
        \end{equation*}
        on each (open) interval $\open{t_i}{t_{i+1}}$ of its partition $\partition{\tzero=t_0}{t_p=\tzero+T}$.
        If the function $x$ is a solution for all $T>0$, it is called \emph{global}.
    \end{definition}

    The piecewise continuity of the derivative means that the left limits
    \begin{equation*}
        \lim_{s\upto t_i}\D{x}(s) = \lim_{s\upto t_i}f(s,x(s),x(s-\tau_1),\ldots,x(s-\tau_k))
    \end{equation*}
    exist for $i\in\set{\range{1}{p}}$ and that
    \begin{equation*}
        \lim_{s\downto t_i}\D{x}(s) = f(t_i,x(t_i),x(t_i-\tau_1),\ldots,x(t_i-\tau_k))
    \end{equation*}
    for the right limits in $t_i$, $i\in\set{\range{0}{p-1}}$.
    This is equivalent to the fact that it holds for the \emph{right derivative}
    \begin{equation*}
        \D{x_+}(t)\defeq
        \lim_{s\downto t}\frac{x(s)-x(t)}{s-t}
        = f(t,x(t),x(t-\tau_1),\ldots,x(t-\tau_k))
    \end{equation*}
    for all $t\in\compactum{\tzero}{\tzero+T}$.


\section{Method of Steps}
    \label{sec:method-of-steps}

    If we restrict the IVP~\eqref{eq:ivp} onto an interval $\compactum{\tzero}{\tzero+T_1}$ with $T_1\leq\taumin$, then the values of each $x(t-\tau_j)$ is specified by the initial condition and can thus be replaced by $x_{\tzero}(t-\tau_j)$.
    We obtain an \emph{initial value problem} for an \emph{ordinary differential equation}.
    If we can solve this ordinary IVP, i.e.\ if we can find a solution of the ODE on $\compactum{\tzero}{\tzero+T_1}$, then we can reapply this method by plugging the computed solution into the DDE and solving the resulting ODE on the interval $\compactum{\tzero+T_1}{\tzero+T_2}$, where again $T_2\leq\taumin$. As long as one can solve the resulting ordinary differential equation (for suitable $f$ and $x_{\tzero}$, the existence and uniqueness of a solution is guaranteed by Picard-Lindelöf's theorem), this step can be iterated.

    This method, which allows to convert a DDE into an ODE on a certain interval, eliminating the explicit dependence on the past by inserting the initial condition, is known as \emph{method of steps}.
    Examples using this method are given in~\cite{Falbo06FDEs}.

        % FIXME: dont I need xtau in right side ???
        A function $f\from\deff\to\R^n$ is called \emph{(locally) Lipschitz continuous} (in its $j$-th argument, referring to $t$ as zeroth argument) if and only if for all $a,b\in\R$ and $M>0$ there is a $L>0$, such that
        \begin{equation*}

        % and Lipschitz continuous in its first argument.
        The integral is meant to be componentwise, if $f$ is vector-valued.
    \end{lemma}
    \begin{proof}
        Let $x$ be a solution of the IVP for a $T>0$. Thus $x$ is (by definition) piecewise continuous on $\compactum{\tzero-\taumax}{\tzero}$ and continuous and piecewise continuously differentiable on $\compactum{\tzero}{\tzero+T}$ with (piecewise) derivative $t\mapsto f(t,x(t),x(t-\tau_1),\ldots,x(t-\tau_k))$.
        % This composition of a continuous and piecewise continuous function is again piecewise continuous (Lemma~\ref{lm:comp-pw-cont}) and hence by Lemma~\ref{lm:pc-integrable} integrable on $\compactum{\tzero}{\tzero+T}$.
        By Lemma~\ref{lm:pc-hauptsatz} it follows
        \begin{equation*}
            x(t) = x_{\tzero}(\tzero) + \integral{\tzero}{t} f(s,x(s),x(s-\tau_1),\ldots,x(s-\tau_k))\dx[s]
        \end{equation*}
        for $t\compactum{\tzero}{\tzero+T}$, since $x_{\tzero}(\tzero)=x(\tzero)$. This means that $x$ fulfills the integral equation.

        Conversely, let $x$ be a solution of the integral equation on $\compactum{\tzero-\taumax}{\tzero+T}$.
        By the fundamental theorem of calculus, $x$ is continuous on $\compactum{\tzero}{\tzero+T}$.

        From the partition $\partition{t_0}{t_p}$ of $x_{\tzero}$, we construct a partition of $\compactum{\tzero}{\tzero+T}$ by
        % FIXME: inprecise, define properly
        \begin{equation}\label{eq:partition}
            \mathcal{Z}\defeq \partition{\hat{t}_0}{\hat{t}_q}
            \defeq \set{\tzero,\tzero+T}\cup\bigcup_{j=1}^{k}\bigcup_{\substack{i=1\\t_i+\tau_j\geq\tzero}}^{p}\set{t_i+\tau_j}
        \end{equation}
        Let $t\in\open{\hat{t}_{l-1}}{\hat{t}_l}$ for any $l\in\set{\range{1}{q}}$. If for any $j\in\set{\range{1}{k}}$ and $i\in\set{\range{0}{p}}$ was $t-\tau_j = t_i$, then $t=t_i+\tau_j=\hat{t}_r$ for a $r\in\set{\range{1}{p}}$ by the construction of $\mathcal{Z}$. However this would be a contradiction to the choice of $t$. Hence $t-\tau_j \neq t_i$ for all $j\in\set{\range{1}{k}}$ and $i\in\set{\range{0}{m}}$, which implies that each $s\mapsto x(s-\tau_j)=x_{\tzero}(s-\tau_j)$ is continuous in the point $t$. Thus the composition
        \begin{equation*}
            s\mapsto f(s,x(s),x(s-\tau_1),\ldots,x(s-\tau_k))
        \end{equation*}
        is continuous in $t$. The fundamental theorem of calculus states in this case that $x$ is differentiable in the point $t$ and that $\D{x}(t)=f(t,x(t),x(t-\tau_1),\ldots,x(t-\tau_k))$.

        For the right limits it follows by the continuity of $f$ and the existence of the limits $\lim_{t\downto\hat{t}_l} x(t-\tau_j) = x(\hat{t}_l-\tau_j)$, that
        % FIXME: elaborate l and j in line before

            &= f(\hat{t}_l,x(\hat{t}_l),x(\hat{t}_l-\tau_1),\ldots,x(\hat{t}_l-\tau_k))
        \end{align*}

        \begin{equation*}
            \lim_{t\upto\hat{t}_l} \D{x}(t) = \lim_{t\upto\hat{t}_l} f(t,x(s),x(t-\tau_1),\ldots,x(t-\tau_k))
        \end{equation*}
        exist for the same reason.
        % FIXME: replace 'summarily'
        Summarily, $x$ is continuous and piecewise continuously differentiable on $\compactum{\tzero}{\tzero+T}$ with piecewise derivative $f$ and it obviously obeys the initial condition, i.e. $x(t)=x_{\tzero}(t)$ for all $t\in\compactum{\tzero-\tau}{\tzero}$.

    The most important result for the considered class of delay differential equations is the following theorem.
    % FIXME: include Theorem into cite
    Its proof is an adaption and extension of the existence theorem (Theorem 3.7) given in~\cite{Smith10IntroDDE} and the proof of uniqueness in \cite{PruessWilke10GewDiffGl}. It essentially reduces the DDE to a piecewise ODE by applying the method of steps.

    \begin{theorem}[Existence of a unique solution]

        The duration $T>0$ depends on the sup-norm and the partition of the initial condition, as well as the right hand side $f$.

    \begin{proof}
        % FIXME: where sup-norm? define notation
        Let $\partition{-\taumax=t_0}{t_p=0}$ be the partition of $x_{\tzero}$. As a piecewise continuous function, the initial condition can be bounded on $\closeddelayinterval[-\taumax]$ by any $M\geq \supnorm{x_\tzero}$.

        Since $f$ is continuous, its sup-norm admits a maximum $K>0$
        on the compact set

        %given by Lemma~\ref{lm:bounded-lipschitz}
        Let $L>0$ be the Lipschitz constant of $f$ for that set with respect to its first argument.
        We put $T\defeq\min\set{\taumin,\frac{M}{K}}$ to restrict in the following the domain of $f$ as integrand to $S$.

        We construct a series $\{\seq{x}{m}\}_{m\in\N_0}$ of piecewise continuous functions, which approximates the solution of the initial value problem. Set

                x_\tzero(t-\tzero) & \text{for } t\in\compactum{\tzero-\taumax}{\tzero}

            \end{dcases*}
        \end{equation*}
        The integral exists, because the integrand is a composition of a continuous and piecewise continuous function, which is again piecewise continuous (Lemma~\ref{lm:comp-pw-cont}) and hence by Lemma~\ref{lm:pc-integrable} integrable and continuous on $\compactum{\tzero}{\tzero+T}$.

        It holds for all $m>0$ by the definition of this sequence that
        \begin{equation*}
            \nnorm*{\seq{x}{m}(t)-\seq{x}{m-1}(t)} = 0 \quad\text{for } t\in \compactum{\tzero-\taumax}{\tzero}.
        \end{equation*}
        We show by induction over $m$ that it holds
        \begin{equation*}
            \nnorm*{\seq{x}{m}(t)-\seq{x}{m-1}(t)} \leq \frac{K}{L}\frac{L^m (t-\tzero)^m}{m!} \quad\text{for all } t\in [\tzero,\tzero+T].
        \end{equation*}
        Let $t\in [\tzero,\tzero+T]$. Since for all $s\in [\tzero-\taumax,\tzero+T]$ obviously $\nnorm{\seq{x}{0}(s)}\leq M$, the statement for $m=1$ follows from the boundedness of $f$ on $S$ and the triangle inequality for integrals:
        \begin{equation*}
            \nnorm{\seq{x}{1}(t)-\seq{x}{0}(t)} = \nnorm*{\integral{\tzero}{t} f(s,\seq{x}{0}(s),\seq{x}{0}(s-\tau_1),\ldots,,\seq{x}{0}(s-\tau_k))\dx[s]} \leq K(t-\tzero)
        \end{equation*}
        In the inductive step for any $m>0$, we assume that $\nnorm{\seq{x}{m-1}(s)}\leq 2M$ for all $s\in [\tzero-\taumax,\tzero+T]$, what implies that also
        % TODO: why do integral and norm commute? once integral over vectors, once over scalars
        \begin{align}\label{eq:bounded-xm}

        with the triangle inequality and the choice of $T\leq\frac{M}{K}$.

        Using this and given the second restriction on $T\leq\taumin$, it follows by the Lipschitz property of $f$ (for its first argument) that
        \begin{multline*}

        for all $t\in [\tzero,\tzero+T]$, i.e. $\{\seq{x}{m}\}$ is a Cauchy sequence.
        Since each $\seq{x}{m}$ is continuous on $\compactum{\tzero}{\tzero+T}$, this Cauchy sequence has a limit $x$ in the Banach space $\Cn[0]{\compactum{\tzero}{\tzero+T}}{\R^n}$ with respect to the sup-norm.

        Again, we extend the continuous $x$ backwards to $\compactum{\tzero-\taumax}{\tzero}$ with the piecewise continuous $x_\tzero$, such that $x\in\Cnpw[0]{\compactum{\tzero-\tau}{\tzero+T}}{\R^n}$.

        By the continuity of the sup-norm it follows from~\eqref{eq:bounded-xm} that

        Given this bound, the uniform convergence (convergence in sup-norm) of $\seq{x}{m}\to x$, implies the uniform convergence

            f(s,\seq{x}{m}(s),\seq{x}{m}(s-\tau_1),\ldots,\seq{x}{m}(s-\tau_k)) \xrightarrow{m\to\infty} f(s,x(s),x(s-\tau_1),\ldots,x(s-\tau_k))

        and hence we can commute the integral and the limit process in

    In the following chapters, we will only consider autonomous DDEs. This allows to restrict to the case of time-independent $f$ and initial time $\tzero=0$.
    The notion of solution for an autonomous DDE can be lifted to be a trajectory $\trajectory$ in the state space
    \begin{equation}
        \trajectory \from \compactum{0}{T} \to \statespace[-\taumax]
    \end{equation}
    The \emph{state} at time $t\in\compactum{0}{T}$ is a function which provides a time limited history of the past evolution. This is all information needed to determine (using the DDE) the solution at time $\tilde{t}\geq t$.
    This notion of solution is a \emph{dynamical systems'} point of view which turns out to be useful later.

    Other results know from ordinary differential equations can be adapted to delay differential equations, such as continuous (or even differentiable) dependence of the solution on initial data, etc.\ (cf.~\cite{Dads06DDEs}).

    % TODO: example earlier

        has the solution $x(t)=x_0 \e{-t}$. However the similar DDE
        \begin{equation*}
            \begin{cases}
                \D{x}(t) = -x(t-\tau) & t\geq 0\\

        \end{equation*}
        has a much complexer dynamics, which is shown in Figure~\ref{fig:plot-ex-dde} for $x_0\equiv 1$. The solution can be computed as a series of polynomial pieces by the method of steps.
